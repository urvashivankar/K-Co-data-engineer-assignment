## 🎯 Assignment Parts Overview

### Part A: Data Understanding & Quality Checks ✅

**Deliverables:**
- [`part_a_data_profiling.ipynb`](notebooks/part_a_data_profiling.ipynb) - Comprehensive profiling notebook
- [`Part_A_Summary.md`](docs/Part_A_Summary.md) - Written summary with findings

**Key Findings:**
- **No missing values** across 5,851 records
- **No duplicate records** on composite keys
- **Complete date coverage** (100 consecutive days)
- **7 data quality risks identified:**
  1. Negative cost values (36 records - credits/refunds)
  2. Potential for duplicate records without constraints
  3. Inconsistent service naming across clouds
  4. Missing date continuity validation
  5. No data type validation
  6. Wide cost range without outlier detection
  7. No referential integrity checks

---

### Part B: Data Modeling ✅

**Deliverables:**
- [`er_diagram.png`](diagram/er_diagram.png) - Star schema ER diagram
- [`Part_B_Data_Model.md`](docs/Part_B_Data_Model.md) - Complete schema documentation

**Schema Design:**
- **Fact Table:** `fact_cloud_billing` (daily grain per service/team/env/provider)
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - `dim_date` - Time dimension with fiscal calendar support
  - `dim_service` - Cloud service catalog
  - `dim_team` - Organizational structure
  - `dim_environment` - Environment classification (prod/staging/dev)
  - `dim_cloud_provider` - Cloud provider reference

**Design Decisions:**
- Star schema for query simplicity and performance
- Surrogate keys for flexibility
- Daily grain balances detail with performance
- Separate `is_credit` flag for negative costs

---

### Part C: SQL Transformations ✅

**Deliverables:**
- [`part_c_transformations.sql`](sql/part_c_transformations.sql) - All SQL queries
- [`Part_C_SQL_Results.md`](docs/Part_C_SQL_Results.md) - Query results & analysis

**Queries Developed:**
1. **Unified Cloud Billing View** - Combined AWS + GCP with standardized columns
2. **Monthly Spend by Cloud Provider** - Trend analysis with MoM growth
3. **Monthly Spend by Team & Environment** - Chargeback reporting
4. **Top 5 Most Expensive Services** - Cost optimization opportunities

**Key Insights:**
- **EC2 dominates** at 78% of total spend
- **AWS costs 14% more** than GCP on average
- **Production environments** account for only 50% of spend (optimization opportunity)

---

### Part D: Pipeline Design ✅

**Deliverables:**
- [`pipeline_architecture.png`](diagram/pipeline_architecture.png) - Architecture diagram
- [`Part_D_Pipeline_Design.md`](docs/Part_D_Pipeline_Design.md) - Complete design document

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow (daily batch at 6:30 AM UTC)
- **Storage:** Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- **Transformation:** dbt for SQL-based transformations
- **Validation:** Great Expectations for data quality
- **Monitoring:** Datadog + CloudWatch with PagerDuty alerts
- **Warehouse:** Snowflake (cloud-agnostic recommendation)

**SLA:** Data available in analytics zone by 8 AM UTC (90-minute window)

---

### Part E: Value Extraction (FinOps Mindset) ✅

**Deliverables:**
- [`Part_E_FinOps_Analysis.md`](docs/Part_E_FinOps_Analysis.md) - Anomaly analysis & recommendations

**Anomaly Identified:**
- **EC2 cost spike on March 8, 2025:** $503.40 (61% above average)
- **Location:** GCP proj-gamma, Core team, production environment

**Root Causes:**
1. Unintentional auto-scaling event or manual scaling action
2. Instance type migration without rightsizing

**Recommended Action:**
Implement automated weekly rightsizing analysis with budget alerts at 120% of 7-day rolling average, potentially saving **15-20% on annual compute costs**.

**Additional Insights:**
- Non-production environments consume 50% of spend (optimization opportunity: **$50-60K/year**)
- EC2 concentration risk at 78% of spend (reserved instances could save **$80-100K/year**)
- Multi-cloud cost parity suggests need for TCO analysis

## 🎓 What I Learned

1. **Data Quality is Critical:** Even clean-looking data has hidden risks (negative costs, potential duplicates)
2. **Star Schema Simplicity:** Denormalized dimensions make analytics queries much easier
3. **FinOps Mindset:** Cost optimization requires both technical analysis and business context
4. **Production Thinking:** Real pipelines need validation, monitoring, and error handling
5. **Multi-Cloud Complexity:** Managing two clouds adds operational overhead that must be justified
